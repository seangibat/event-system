#A Few Things#

There were slightly differing instructions regarding what should be displayed in each row. The text said {title} {from}-{to}, but the pictures had the from and to as part of the details. I put them as part of the details, but I could easily move them up to the summary row.

Thank you for the opportunity! I'd be happy to talk about my implementation with you.
